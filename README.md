### 🚀 Projects

### 💬 **[Real-time Chat Application with End-to-End Encryption](https://github.com/abhinn14/chatapy)**
- Built a real-time chat app using **MERN**, **JWT**, and **Socket.io** that supported concurrent users with an average message latency of <100ms.
- Implemented end-to-end encryption using the Web Crypto API (Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm), ensuring 100% confidentiality of all client-to-client messages.

### ❄️ **[IoT & ML: Smart AC Anomaly Detection System](https://github.com/abhinn14/Logger)**
- Collaborated with a team in developing Logger, an IoT-based monitoring system for ACs that captures real-time temperature, humidity, vibration, current and voltage data.
- Designed the receiver system to visualize data trends and applied **Isolation Forest** for anomaly detection with 100% accuracy, enabling predictive maintenance.

### 💸 **[Real-Time Fraud Detection in Banking transactions using ML](https://github.com/abhinn14/Logger)**
- Collaborated with a team in developing Logger, an IoT-based monitoring system for ACs that captures real-time temperature, humidity, vibration, current and voltage data.
- Designed the receiver system to visualize data trends and applied **Isolation Forest** for anomaly detection with 100% accuracy, enabling predictive maintenance.

### 📝 **[AI Feedback Collection Platform](https://github.com/abhinn14/feedback)**
- Built a MERN app for creating and sharing feedback forms with JWT-based admin authentication and Zustand for lightweight state management.
- Enabled sharing public URLs with customers for seamless feedback collection and integrated OpenAI API to auto-summarize responses for admins and added CSV export functionality for data analysis of responses.

### 🔗 **[URL Shortener](https://github.com/abhinn14/URL-Shortener)**
